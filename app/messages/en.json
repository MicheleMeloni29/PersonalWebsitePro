So we decided to create an application that would allow users to organize their own small vegetable garden at home and keep it under control even remotely with various humidity sensors and a remote irrigation device. The login is managed so that every time the user wants to log in, they must first register by filling in the mandatory fields. Once the data is stored, the user can log in. The home page shows the user the state of the sensors and the possibility to irrigate the garden. The application also allows you to add new plants, view the history of irrigation and sensor data, and receive notifications when the plants need attention. The project was a great opportunity to apply our knowledge of Java and Android development, as well as to work collaboratively in a team.",

The player controls the frog using the arrow keys to move up, down, left, or right. The goal is to reach the other side of the screen without getting hit by cars or falling into the water. The game features a simple scoring system, where the player earns points for successfully crossing the road and river.

So I created this app that lets you view weather forecasts (using APIs provided by OpenWeatherMap). Users can register, which stores them in the database, and then log in to open their own session, which saves their settings and the locations they've chosen for the forecast. By default, you always have the weather forecast card for the device's current location. If you want to see weather forecasts for other locations, you can use the dedicated screen to search for the location of your choice or pick it on the map and insert it. You will then have a new card on the home screen with the new location and its weather forecast.",

These cards can only be collected for now, but I'm working on other app implementations, such as card trading between users or even card games where users challenge each other with their own cards.

During development, I explored the use of shared repositories (Git/GitHub), learning to effectively manage branches, merges, and pull requests, thus improving my ability to collaborate in structured development environments.

The focus was on user experience and enhancing the work, using fluid transitions, animated sequences, and a layout designed to guide the user through navigation.
